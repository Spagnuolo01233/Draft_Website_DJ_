# Draft_Website_DJ_

Welcome to the repository of a draft website I created for my DJ friend. This project was developed to provide a preview of the website I designed.

# Project Description

In this project, I have created a draft website consisting of three HTML pages (index.html - galleria.html - musica.html), all designed to represent the layout and style of the final website. The site utilizes the Bootstrap framework to ensure a modern and responsive design and is customized with a CSS stylesheet (style.css) to meet the specific needs.

# Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

# Usage Instructions

Clone this repository to your computer.
Open the HTML pages in your web browser to explore the layout and style of the draft website.
